# My Setup

I need to be able to test what I'm doing, and since I'm doing it on what
amounts to my work laptop, I want to be able to get back up and running with
amounts to very little down time.

In my mind, the amount of time I should be offline should be equal to the
amount of time it takes to perform the full install.

## Hardware that matters

* My Macbook Pro 13" Retina
* 8GB USB Key containing Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop x86_64
* Nifty SD Card MiniDrive
* Samsung 64GB MicroSD Card

## Services that matter

* Dropbox
* Github
* Slack

## Applications that matter

* Chrome
* Atom
* Docker
* Chef tools (chefvm, knife, etc)
* Some other dev stuff

It should be clear that my requirements are pretty light with regards to
services and applications; I'm a DevOps Engineer and most of my work is either
writing code, research about writing code, terminal use when running code, and
SSH for reaching out to servers.
